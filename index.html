      <h2>About</h2>
      <div id="content-about">
        Throughout high school and college, I was interested in both biology and
        computer science, but ultimately ended up pursuing a biology major. I
        graduated from Brandeis University in 2015 with the goal of attending
        medical school, and spent several years working as an anesthesia
        technician to get more experience in the hospital environment. I was
        eventually accepted to the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth
        College in 2017, and I believed I was set to achieve my dreams and
        become a doctor. However, that proved not to be the case. I struggled to
        be the version of myself I felt that I needed to be - when I made
        mistakes, I should have studied harder. If I was enjoying myself, I
        shouldn't let myself get distracted. I found I was cutting ties with
        friends old and new, dropping hobbies I used to love, and despite it all
        - I still wasn't good enough. This was supposed to be what I wanted to
        be doing with my life, and I was miserable. So I requested a leave of
        absence from Geisel, moved to be with my partner in LA, and I'm now
        exploring what my future could look like if I shifted my focus towards
        software development. I've been progressing through The Odin Project's
        Foundations and Javascript paths to solidify the basics of HTML, CSS,
        and Javascript, and I'm currently enrolled in Springboard's Software
        Engineering course. I've also resumed some of my hobbies; feel free to
        ask me about baking bread or nerd out with me over D&D, MtG, or DotA!
