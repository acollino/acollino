        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout high school and college, I was interested in both biology
          and computer science, but ultimately ended up pursuing a biology
          major. I graduated from Brandeis University in 2015 with the goal of
          attending medical school, and spent several years working as an
          anesthesia technician before attending the Geisel School of Medicine
          at Dartmouth College.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, I struggled to be the version of myself I felt that I needed
          to be - when I made mistakes, I should have studied harder. If I was
          enjoying myself, I shouldn't let myself get distracted. I found I was
          cutting ties with friends old and new, dropping hobbies I used to
          love, and despite it all - I still wasn't good enough. This was
          supposed to be what I wanted to be doing with my life, and I was
          miserable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, I requested a leave of absence from Geisel and moved to be
          with my partner in LA. I'm now exploring what my future could look
          like if I shifted my focus towards software development. To that end,
          I'm enrolled in Springboard's Software Engineering course, and I'm
          building up coding projects that are available above. I've also resumed
          some of my hobbies; feel free to ask me about baking bread or nerd out
          with me over D&D, MtG, or DotA!
